Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax of DoIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

However, a PWA brings some extra benefits that might be useful. Pages will be automatically cached by service workers when the app is installed, which enables a near-instantaneous loading from the second visit. Users can always visit cached pages when they are offline. These features may be useful for some websites, such as this documentation site. But it does not make much sense to turn a personal blog into a PWA. In the end, it all depends on your choice, and the DoIt theme will provide this feature for you anyway.
