However, a PWA brings some extra benefits that might be useful. Pages will be automatically cached by service workers when the app is installed, which enables a near-instantaneous loading from the second visit. Users can always visit cached pages when they are offline. These features may be useful for some websites, such as this documentation site. But it does not make much sense to turn a personal blog into a PWA. In the end, it all depends on your choice, and the DoIt theme will provide this feature for you anyway.
